# news-feed-directory
The list that powers the http://LevelNews.org [news feed directory](https://levelnews.org/chat/feeds/directory). The channel list is in [JSON format](http://www.json.org/example.html). There are also a couple of filters available in `filters.js`.

If you'd like to make a suggestion, please click the "Issues" tab in the GitHub repository. Or if you feel like writing some JSON and opening a GitHub pull request, feel free to do so.
